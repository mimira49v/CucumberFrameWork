# Overview
We want to implement a scalable, parallel UI test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver. The tests should run in parallel across multiple browsers using a Selenium Grid setup hosted on AWS EC2 instances, with Docker containers managing the browser nodes. This will enable fast feedback and cross-browser coverage for our web application.

# Core Features
- Parallel execution of Selenium UI tests
- Selenium Grid setup using Docker containers
- Grid hub and nodes running on AWS EC2 instances
- Support for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- Integration with CI/CD (Jenkins or GitHub Actions)
- Automated test reporting and screenshots for failures

# User Experience
- QA engineers can trigger tests from CI/CD or locally
- Test results and reports are easily accessible
- Adding new tests or browsers is straightforward

# Technical Architecture
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate Selenium Grid (hub + browser nodes)
- Deploy Dockerized Selenium Grid on AWS EC2 instances (Linux)
- Connect test runner (local or CI) to remote Selenium Grid hub
- Store test results and screenshots in S3 (optional)
- Use Java, Maven, and TestNG/Cucumber for test implementation

# Development Roadmap
- Phase 1: Set up Dockerized Selenium Grid locally
- Phase 2: Provision AWS EC2 instances and deploy Selenium Grid
- Phase 3: Configure test framework for remote execution
- Phase 4: Implement parallel test execution
- Phase 5: Integrate with CI/CD and reporting

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Local Docker Grid setup → AWS EC2 provisioning → Remote Grid deployment → Framework config → Parallelization → CI/CD integration

# Risks and Mitigations
- Network/firewall issues: Ensure proper security group settings on EC2
- Docker compatibility: Use official Selenium images
- Cost: Use spot instances or auto-shutdown scripts
