======================================== Important about steps ========================================
We created separate package for API steps because if we continue to use the previous steps package we have a problem
of hooks where we have pre conditions and post conditions we can not use pre conditions and post conditions
applicable for UI and API that's why we created a separate steps.

Rest assured API

It is DSL (domain specific language)
It is java based libriarry that is used to automate rest API
         Given -- pre-condition
         When -- actions
         And -- supporting tag
         Then -- results
Rest assured follows the functionality of BDD
pre-condition - request preparation, request specification
given - prepare the request
when  - hitting the end point (send the request)
then - expected response

NOTE : baseURI = baseURL
