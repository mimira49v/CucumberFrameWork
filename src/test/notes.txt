Gherkin language

Given - precondition
When -  actions we need to perform
And - supporting tag
Then - then expected results

========= Recap =========
What is framework?
- It is an organized structure of folders and packages which allows us to write clean
and maintainable code.
Build management tool --> maven
pom.xml is the main configuration file in maven project.

Main - it is used to write the code for development
test - it is used to write the code to test the application
    -- java - for tech/coding we use java directory
    -- resources - for non-tech/non code we use resources

Cucumber - it supports BDD
            -- we use gherkin language(plain english text) to write the scenarios
            -- it works with junit

Scenario -- it is a test case
Given -- pre-condition
When -- actions
And -- supporting tag
Then -- results

US 12345 - Employee search

Scenario - search employee by id
Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
When user enters valid admin credentials
And user clicks on login button
And user navigates to employee list page
When user enters valid employee id
And click on search button
Then user is able to see employee information

Scenario - search employee by id
Given user is navigated to HRMS Application
When user enters valid admin credentials
And user clicks on login button
And user navigates to employee list page
When user enters valid name
And clicks on search button
Then user is able to see employee information

File where we write BDD scenarios is feature file
this file has .feature extension
=====================================================================
Class 3
Recap - we use feature file to write our scenarios

- search employee by id
- search employee by name

In feature file we write scenarios using gherking language
- Given, when, and, then, scenario, feature.

After feature file, we need to create step definitions

after feature file, we need to
=======================================================================
Class 4
Recap - common methods class in our framework is used to write all the methods we will be using in
the majority of scenarios(Code reusability)

sendText method, click etc

In constants class we provided implicit wait, explicit wait values and test data path

Page object model is a design pattern
According to page object model, we create page classes for all the screens available in the application
=========================================================================
Class 5 Recap

Creating multiple steps classes for multiple feature files.

Page Object model design pattern

In common methods we are calling page initializers method, this method is going to call the objects of
page classes which will call the constructor and these constructors will initialize all the web elements
